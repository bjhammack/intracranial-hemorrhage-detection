# Identifying Intracranial Hemorrhaging in CT Scan Images
(note: to read the comprehensive and detailed write-up on this project please view intracranial_hemorrhage_detection_writeup.pdf)

Brain hemorrhaging can be one of the most dangerous situations a person faces. If not identified and treated quickly, it can put your life in serious danger and potentially cause long lasting damage. Identifying hemorrhages in CT scans quickly and accurately is often the deciding factor between which of these situations come to fruition.

This project employs a neural network inside a Jupyter Notebook to analyze 100,000+ images of brain CT scans and identify A) whether hemorrhaging is occurring and B) what type of hemorrhaging is occuring.
